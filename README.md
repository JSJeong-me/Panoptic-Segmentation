    Medical imagery, where instances as well as amorphous regions help shape the context.
    Self driving cars and autonomous vehicles, as we need to know what objects are around the vehicle, but also what surface the vehicle is driving on.
    Digital Image processing. Want a better smartphone camera? Software that can have pixel-wise comprehension of the people in the image as well as what comprises the background will give you that.
